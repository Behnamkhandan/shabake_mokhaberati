# ðŸ“¡ Design of a Simple Federated Learning System for Energy Optimization in Edge Devices over Wireless Networks

## ðŸ§  Introduction

This project explores the design of a lightweight and energy-efficient Federated Learning (FL) system tailored for edge devices operating in wireless networks. FL allows multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared machine learning model without exchanging raw data, preserving privacy and reducing communication overhead.

In wireless edge environmentsâ€”such as IoT sensors, mobile phones, and smart devicesâ€”energy consumption is a critical constraint. This project focuses on optimizing energy usage through simple scheduling strategies and aggregation techniques, making it suitable for undergraduate students to understand and simulate.

The system will be implemented using Python-based tools and will emphasize:

- Low-complexity FL architecture for edge devices  
- Energy-aware scheduling and participation control  
- Wireless communication constraints and asynchronous updates  
- Practical simulation scenarios for learning and experimentation

The goal is to provide a clear, hands-on framework for students to explore federated learning in real-world edge computing contexts, with minimal complexity and maximum educational value.
